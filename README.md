# cthyb-ohmic

The program `cthyb_ohmic` aims to two goals:

1. Couple the impurity to at least two different resovoirs simultanously, so that problems such as
   a single quantum dot coupled to multiple metallic leads can be handled straightforwardly.
2. Introduce an ohmic environment to model the dissipation.

This hybridization code is derived from the cthyb impurity solver of the [ALPS project](https://alps.comp-phys.org/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page), which is currently maintained at [ALPSCore/alps-cthyb](https://github.com/ALPSCore/alps-cthyb). 
However, the original code is based on ALPS ver.2.2.b3-r7462, and for the moment I have no intention to support 
[ALPSCore](https://github.com/ALPSCore/ALPSCore), a spinoff of the ALPS project.

The development platform for this code is OS X 10.10.4, and this code has been tested on Mac, 
Fedora, and Debian.
