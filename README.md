# cthyb-ohmic

This hybridization code is adapted from the cthyb impurity solver, which is part of the ALPS-DMFT
project. The goal here is to couple the impurity to at least two different resovoirs simultanously,
and to introduce an ohmic environment modeling the dissipation as well.

The code is developed with ALPS ver.2.2.b3-r7462 distributed on Mac OS X. The development platform
is OS X 10.10.4.
